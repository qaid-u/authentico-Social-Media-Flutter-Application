# Authentico

## App Features
•	Dual camera mode: This would allow users to take a photo with both their front and rear cameras at the same time, providing a more complete view of their surroundings.
•	Geotagging: This would allow users to see where their friends are when they take their photos, adding an extra layer of context and engagement.
•	Private lockets: This would allow users to upload a photo that is only visible to a select group of friends. This would be great for sharing personal moments or for keeping certain photos private.
•	Interactivity: This would allow users to interact with their friends' lockets in new and fun ways. For example, users could tap on a friend's photo to send them a quick message or to give them a thumbs up.
•	Captioning: Allow user to caption their photo briefly not more than 35 words.
•	Allow users to choose whether to receive a notification at a random time. This would give users more control over their experience and allow them to choose when they want to share a photo.
•	Reciprocal sharing: Users can only see their friends' photos if they share a photo with them in return. This helps to create a more reciprocal and engaging social media experience.
•	Challenges: Offer daily or weekly challenges, such as taking a photo of your favorite object, your pet, or your favorite view. This would encourage users to get creative and share different aspects of their lives.
•	Reward system: Every time a challenge is completed, user may be ranked up, and rewarded with badges.
•	Recap feature: Recap and go through all posts of your friends.
•	Photo album feature: Showcase all posts from user and user’s friends.

## Background
Social media has become an integral part of our lives, but it can also be a breeding ground for unrealistic expectations and fake content. Apps like BeReal and Locket are trying to address this by encouraging users to share more authentic and spontaneous moments.
Authentico is a new social application with the same concept. We believe that there is a need for a social platform where people can feel comfortable sharing their real lives, without having to worry about filters, editing, or getting the perfect shot.

## Opportunity or Problem
Social media has a number of negative impacts on our mental health, including:
•	Increased anxiety and depression: Social media can create a false sense of comparison, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression.
•	Decreased self-esteem: Seeing other people's carefully curated lives can make us feel inadequate about our own lives.
•	Loneliness: Social media can be isolating, as we can spend hours scrolling through feeds without actually connecting with anyone.

Authentico is an opportunity to create a social platform that is more positive and supportive. By encouraging users to share their real lives, Authentico can help to reduce the pressure to be perfect and foster a more authentic community.

Why is the Project Being Undertaken?
We are undertaking this project because we believe that social media can be a force for good. We want to create a platform where people can feel comfortable sharing their real lives, without having to worry about filters, editing, or getting the perfect shot. We believe that Authentico can help to create a more positive and supportive online community.

•	Create a social platform where people can feel comfortable sharing their real lives.

## Scope of the Project
The scope of the Authentico project is to develop a social application that allows users to share authentic and spontaneous moments with their friends. The app will be designed for users of all ages, but the target audience is young adults (ages 18-35).
The app will have the following features:
•	Users will be able to share a photo once a day, at a random time.
•	Users can only see their friends' photos if they share a photo with them in return.
•	Users will not be able to filter or edit their photos.
•	Users will be able to see their friends' photos, even if they don't post themselves.
•	Users will be able to caption on their own photos, comment on and react to their friends' photos.
•	Users will be able to create a profile with their name, assigned user ID and profile picture.
•	Users may be ranked up, and rewarded with badges whenever a challenge is completed.
•	Users can choose whether to receive a notification at a random time. 
•	Geotagging for users to locate where their photo was taken.
•	Users have a dual camera mode that offers a complete view of their surroundings.

## Significance of the Project
Authentico is significant because it addresses a few problems with traditional social media platforms. First, Authentico encourages users to be more authentic and spontaneous. By not allowing users to filter or edit their photos and videos, Authentico creates a platform where people can feel comfortable sharing their real lives.
Second, Authentico promotes connection and community. By sharing authentic moments with their friends Authentico users are able to connect with each other on a deeper level. Additionally, the app's random notification system ensures that users are seeing their friends' real lives, rather than just their carefully curated feeds and the reciprocal system ensures every each of the user stays connected.
Finally, Authentico has the potential to have a positive impact on mental health. By reducing the pressure to be perfect, Authentico can help to create a more positive and supportive online community.
Significance Towards the Selected Scope of Users
Authentico is particularly significant for young adults (ages 18-35) because this demographic is most likely to use social media and is also most likely to be impacted by the negative aspects of social media, such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness.
Authentico can help young adults to feel more comfortable sharing their real lives online and to connect with their friends and family in a more meaningful way. The app can also help to reduce the pressure to be perfect and to create a more positive and supportive online community.
Overall, the Authentico project is a significant undertaking with the potential to make a positive impact on the world, especially for young adults.

##Expected Outcome:
At the end of the project, we will have developed a social application called Authentico that achieves the following outcomes:
•	Users are able to share authentic and spontaneous moments with their friends.
•	Users feel comfortable sharing their real lives, without having to worry about filters, editing, or getting the perfect shot.
•	Users are able to connect with their friends and family in a more meaningful and personal way.
